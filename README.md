# Spotify Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow

## Overview
This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for Spotify playlist data using **Apache Airflow** and **Python**.

The pipeline extracts playlist data from a public JSON dataset, transforms it using **Pandas**, and stores the processed dataset as CSV files.

The workflow is automated using **Airflow DAGs**, where tasks run sequentially to simulate a real-world data engineering pipeline.

# DAG Workflow

The Airflow DAG performs the following steps:

## 1 Extract Task
- Fetch playlist data from JSON API
- Convert it into a dataframe
- Save raw data as `playlist_raw.csv`

## 2 Transform Task
- Convert duration from milliseconds to minutes
- Extract release year
- Remove duplicate tracks
- Handle missing values
- Categorize track popularity

Output file generated:

```
playlist_transformed.csv
```

---

# Example Transformations

New columns generated:

- duration_minutes
- release_year
- popularity_category

Popularity categories:

```
Low      : 0 – 40
Medium   : 41 – 70
High     : 71 – 100
```

# How to Run the Project

## 1 Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/anas29mohd/Spotify-airflow-data-pipeline.git
```

## 2 Navigate to project folder

```
cd spotify-playlist-data-pipeline
```

## 3 Start Airflow using Docker

```
docker-compose up
```

## 4 Open Airflow UI

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Default login credentials:

```
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```

## 5 Trigger the DAG

Enable and run the DAG:

```
spotify_playlist_pipeline
```

Tasks will execute in the following order:

```
extract_playlist_data → transform_playlist_data
```

---

# Output Files

After execution, the pipeline generates:

```
output/playlist_raw.csv
output/playlist_transformed.csv
```

---

# Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

- Add **Load step to database (PostgreSQL / Snowflake)**
- Implement **data validation checks**
- Integrate **data visualization dashboard**
- Schedule automatic daily pipeline execution
- Add **machine learning model for song popularity prediction**
